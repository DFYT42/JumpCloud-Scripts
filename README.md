# JumpCloud_Google_Developer_Hub_API
Scripts to work seemlessly between JumpCloud API &amp; Google Developer Hub Apps Scripts

We wanted to use Google Forms, Docs, Worksheets, and other tools to interact with the JumpCloud API. However, we found it difficult to do this with the JumpCloud API documentation as written. The API information did not translate well to the Google Developer Hub Apps Script js. 

These scripts help make the transition between JumpCloud API documentation and the Google Developer Hub Apps Scripts.
